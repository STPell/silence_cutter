# silence_cutter
Removes excessive silence from the beginning and end of songs. 

## How to run it
This assumes you have Python3.x installed and correctly configured.

1. Download and install `pydub` and the associated `ffmpeg` library
2. Place the songs you want to work on in the same directory as `silence_cutter.py`
3. Edit the configuration parameters in `silence_cutter.py` as required
4. Open your favourite terminal (on Windows I suggest using powershell) and run the utility with the command `python silence_cutter.py`
